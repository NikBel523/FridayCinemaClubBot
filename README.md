# FridayCinemaClubBot

FridayCinemaClubBot is a Telegram bot designed to enhance your Friday evening movie choices.
The bot serves as a platform for tracking both suggested and watched films, 
creating a shared database accessible to multiple users. The primary goal is to make selecting
a movie for Friday nights an enjoyable and collaborative experience.

## Features

- **Suggested Films:** Users can add film suggestions to the shared database, providing an array of choices for the Friday evening movie.
- **Watched Films:** Keep track of the movies that have already been watched. This helps avoid repetition and encourages variety.
- **Shared Database:** The bot provides a convenient platform for several users to access and contribute to the movie suggestions and watched films.
- **Random Film Suggestion:** In the future, an exciting feature will be added to suggest a random film from the unwatched group, making the movie selection process even more spontaneous.
## How to Use

This section will be added as the bot will be developed.
